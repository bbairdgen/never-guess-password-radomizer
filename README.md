# never-guess-password-radomizer

## Description

This project is to create a random password generator. I built this in an effort to learn how to better use JavaScript. I used this as an opportunity to try and expand my knowledge and experiment with different functions. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use the site, click on Generate Password to open the prompts. Make sure you enter a number between 8 and 128, if you do not, you will be sent an alert and then sent back to the first prompt. After choosing the length of your password, follow the prompts. If you want to include that particular character click OK. If you do not want to include that particular character click Cancel. You must select at least ONE character in order to generate a password. If you opt to not use any characters, you will be returned to the first prompt.
